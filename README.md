# InventoryHub

**InventoryHub** is a custom inventory and resource management system designed to provide small businesses and hobbyists with a robust, efficient solution for tracking and managing stock. The platform features a modern Flask-based web interface, an SQLite database for persistent storage, and integrates a custom C shared library (loaded via Pythonâ€™s ctypes) that implements a hash map and Bâ€‘tree. These lowâ€‘level data structures enable fast inâ€‘memory caching and efficient, sorted search indexing, making InventoryHub uniquely powerful and responsive.

## Summary

ðŸŒŸ **What InventoryHub Does**  
InventoryHub is an end-to-end inventory management system that empowers small businesses and hobbyists to efficiently track and manage their stock. It provides a comprehensive dashboard where users can add, update, and delete inventory items, view detailed item information, and manage records securely. By integrating a custom C shared library that implements a hash map and Bâ€‘tree for in-memory caching and search indexing, InventoryHub delivers fast data retrieval and efficient performance alongside modern web technologies.

ðŸŒŸ **Why I Built InventoryHub**  
Inspired by the need for a cost-effective, customizable solution for inventory management, InventoryHub was created to bridge the gap between traditional inventory systems and modern, responsive web applications. The project showcases my ability to combine high-level web development with low-level systems programming, demonstrating both robust application design and optimized performance through custom data structures.

ðŸŒŸ **Why InventoryHub is Unique**  
Unlike conventional inventory systems, InventoryHub uniquely integrates a custom C-based hash map and Bâ€‘tree via Pythonâ€™s ctypes, ensuring rapid, in-memory access to critical data and efficient search capabilities. This hybrid approach provides a scalable and responsive solution, making InventoryHub an ideal platform for dynamic inventory management where speed and reliability are essential.

## Technology

### Languages  
- **Python**: The primary language for building the Flask web application, handling backend logic, and server-side functionality. 
- **C**: Used to implement custom low-level data structures (hash map and Bâ€‘tree) for efficient inâ€‘memory caching and sorted search indexing, integrated via Pythonâ€™s ctypes.

### Frameworks  
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework that powers the backend and dynamic page rendering of the application.
- **Bootstrap**: Provides a modern, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing frontend UI.

### Libraries  
- **ctypes**: A Python library that enables the integration and usage of the custom C shared library within the Flask application.
- **Werkzeug**: Offers utilities for secure password hashing and session management in the Flask framework.

### Tools  
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, file-based database used for persistent storage of user and inventory data.- **Stripe**: Processes payments securely, including service fee handling. Serves as the core database system, managing data for users and inventory items with simplicity and efficiency.
- **Git**: Version control system used to track code changes and facilitate collaboration.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments and smooth deployments via containerization.
